# GUIDE

## Project Instructions

- ### `New Endpoint:`

  - Create a new endpoint in the server.ts file
  - The starter code has a task for you to complete an endpoint in `./src/server.ts` which uses query parameter to download an image from a public URL, filter the image, and return the result.

- ### `Importing the New Endpoint:`

  - Importing it for you at the top of the `./src/server.ts`  file.

    ```typescript
    import {filterImageFromURL, deleteLocalFiles} from './util/util';
    ```

## Perequisite 1 (Installations)

- `Git Installation`:
  - Git Installation: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xqVv2lTo40&ab_channel=TravelsCode)
  - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

## Perequisite 4 (Setup Node Environment):

- `Step 1`: npm i
  - `Optional`: npm audit fix.
- `Step 2`: npm run dev
- `Step 3`: npm run build
  - This Command should be properly set in the 'package.json' file in the same directory
  - If Zip Command Gives Problems: https://stackoverflow.com/a/55749636

## Deploying the System:

- `Step 1`: Open CMD as Addministrator and cd to the code files.
- `Step 2`: You can create a virtual enviromnment (Optional).
- `Step 3`: eb init (run on a terminal)
  - Do you wish to continue with CodeCommit? (`Y/n`): `n`
  - Do you want to set up SSH for your instances?(`Y/n`): `y`
  - Type a keypair name. (`Default is aws-eb`): `Enter`
  - Generate the javascript files into the www directory also add empty tmp folder, The create a zip called Archive.zip. Add this block of code in the config file under the .elasticbeanstalk folder. We must also create a Archive.zip file.

    ```text
    deploy:
        artifact: ./www/Archive.zip
    ```

- `Step 4`: eb create (run on a terminal)
  - Enter Environment Name (`default is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`): `Enter`
  - Enter DNS CNAME prefix (`default is XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`): `Enter` (NB:= This has to be unique)
  - `Select a Load Balancer type`

    1) classic
    2) application
    3) network

    - (`default is 2`): `2`
  - Would you like to enable Spot Fleet requests for this environment? (`y/N`): `n`
- `Step 5`: Done -> "INFO    Successfully launched environment:"
- `Step 6`: NB:= You can use 'eb deploy' to Push Changes

## Stand Out Task (Optional)

- ### `Refactor the course RESTapi:`

  - If you're feeling up to it, refactor the course RESTapi to make a request to your newly provisioned image server.

- ### `Authentication:`

  - Prevent requests without valid authentication headers.
  - Make sure to add the token to the postman collection and export the postman collection file,
  - Add them to your submission so we can review!

- ### `Custom Domain Name:`

  - Add your own domain name and have it point to the running services.
    (try adding a subdomain name to point to the processing server)
  - !NOTE: Domain names are not included in AWS’ free tier and will incur a cost.
